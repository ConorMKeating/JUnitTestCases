# JUnitTestCases
Insurance premium calculator with JUnit tests. Final project for Agile Software Development Methodologies module.

This program was developed at the end of the Agile Software Development module. A simple insurance premium
calculator was written in Java which checks the age and number of accidents a user has had. Based on this
information the insurance is loaded for younger and more accident-prone drivers. The main purpose was to
design a range of Junit tests which are carried out on the insurance program such as whether the correct
values are displayed for people of different ages and accident histories. A suite was also developed to
run the two separate test files.
